# YouTube Long SEO Description

This prompt helps generate SEO-optimised descriptions for YouTube videos. This was created with a **lot** of experimenting,
and trial and error. This seems to score well in VidIQ and TubeBuddy, and is a good starting point for your own.

Before running this prompt, you will need:

* The transcript or voiceover script for your video
* The list of tags you intend adding to your video (up to around 400 characters)
* A list of additional keyword phrases you'd like to include in your description
* A list of keywords you want to avoid
* A list of hashtags you'd like to include in your description

### Step 1: Priming the model

> The following is the voiceover script for a YouTube video:<br>
> `{paste your script here}`
>
> Once you have read this, please say only "I understand".

### Step 2: Generating the description

> Please think like an expert in YouTube SEO and Engagement. Please write a very long essay style description for this video.
>
> Please include the following keyword phrases exactly twice each:<br>
> `{paste your tags here}`
>
> Please include the following keyword phrases exactly once each:<br>
> `{paste your additional keywords here}`
>
> Please avoid the following keyword phrases:<br>
> `{paste your avoid keywords here}`
>
> Please include the following hashtags exactly once each:<br>
> `{paste your hashtags here}`
>
> Please include any other hashtags you think are relevant. Please place hashtags throughout the body of the description, and not just at the end.

### Step 3 (Optional): Generating a Description Introduction

If the previous step generated a description that is a little short, you can use this prompt to generate a short 
introduction. This will generate a one-paragraph introduction that can be placed at the start of the video
description; and **may** increase the SEO score of your video.
